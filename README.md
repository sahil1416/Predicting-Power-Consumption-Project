# Predicting-Power-Consumption-Project
Their goal is to create a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting power consumption in Zone 3. To achieve this, we have compiled specific historical data, including power consumption records, weather conditions, and potential emission diffusion metrics. By analyzing these factors, we aim to develop a model that can effectively anticipate energy demand, enabling us to make informed decisions regarding efficient expansion into further zones.
 
Project Benefits:
•	Improved forecasting: Accurately predicting power consumption in Zone 3 will enable us to optimize resource allocation across our grid, ensuring a reliable and efficient energy supply.
•	Cost savings: Anticipating peak demand periods can potentially reduce our reliance on expensive peak-hour energy sources.
•	Sustainability: Understanding the factors influencing power consumption will inform strategies for promoting energy efficiency and integrating renewable energy sources into Zone 3.
Deliverables:
•	A well-documented machine learning model specifically trained to predict power consumption in Zone 3.
•	A clear explanation of the chosen model architecture and its justification based on your data analysis.
•	Visualizations and performance metrics demonstrating the model's accuracy on unseen data.
•	A comprehensive report summarizing your methodology, results, and recommendations for future development.
Success Criteria:
•	The model achieves a high evaluation score for power consumption prediction in Zone 3.
•	The model demonstrates generalizability by maintaining good performance on unseen data.
•	The project delivers clear documentation and visualizations for effective communication and future use.
Project Guidelines:
•	Timeline: Ensure timely completion and submission of project deliverables by the given deadline.
•	Research Methodology: Explore relationships between different features such as weather, historical consumption, and potential emission factors within the dataset.
•	For confidentiality reasons the data only consists a singular year, so it is important that the model should focus on capturing seasonal patterns rather than relying heavily on the specific year.
•	Report Structure: Document the entire process, including code, results, and key decisions taken.
•	Actionable Recommendations: Provide strategic insights supported by evidence from your research findings.
•	Professionalism: Maintain a high level of professionalism in communication and deliverables, including proper formatting, grammar, and citation practices.
•	Data: The data shared with you is not to be uploaded publicly on any platform(github,kaggle,etc). Feel free to incorporate any other data 'IN ADDITION' to the dataset provided.
Submission:
•	Jupyter notebook containing analysis and model training.
•	Final report as a .doc or PowerPoint presentation.
•	Optional submission of a Power BI or Tableau dashboard.
•	NOTE: Create a zip file of the above mentioned for the final submission.
